# Changelog

All notable changes to Steward are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), so entries can be drafted from the commit history.

## [Unreleased]

The first public version, 0.1.0, is being prepared. It contains everything below.

### Added

**Processes and engine**

- Node-RED-style flow editor with a node palette, labelled outputs and YAML source view.
  - Node types: API call (with pagination and OpenAPI operation picker), set variables, for each (optionally in parallel), if, user task/approval (assignees, four-eyes), check, report section, publish to dashboard, browser automation, run sub-process, wait, fail, comment.
- Versioned processes with inputs, constants, connection slots and outputs.
- Dry runs: read calls run, write calls are only recorded.
- Durable runs: journaled step by step and resumed after a restart without repeating finished steps.
- Expression assistant with autocomplete and live preview, a node inspector with the last run's data, undo/redo, copy/paste between processes, and a YAML diff between versions.
- Scheduling with cron and time zones; scheduled runs use the owner's rights.
- Webhook triggers that start a process from an inbound request:
  - per-trigger secret or HMAC signature, input mapping;
  - rate limits, de-duplication, source address allow-list, audit.
- Example library for Insights Hub and Industrial Edge housekeeping, access reviews, inventory, health and compliance checks, plus example dashboards.

**Monitors**

- Composable, dependency-aware monitors: a graph of checks with soft links (root-cause inference and alert suppression) and hard links (skip while the parent is down), sub-monitors, flapping control, aggregation rules (worst, critical, quorum), maintenance windows and acknowledgements.
- Check types: ping (with TCP fallback), TCP, HTTP(S) (status, JSONata condition, response time, certificate expiry), platform API call, data freshness (Insights Hub time series preset with shared reads per asset/aspect, cadence or maximum age), heartbeat (push), Gatus endpoint, sub-monitor.
- Heartbeat endpoints per check and a gateway batch endpoint with token/HMAC secrets, rate limits, source allow-lists and audit.
- Outputs: notifications (event `monitor.status`), runbooks, webhooks, Gatus external endpoints, Zabbix (sender protocol and `history.push`); pull via the public API (status, history, Zabbix low-level discovery), Prometheus gauges and dashboard datasets.
- Templates with parameters, CSV instantiation and re-sync; YAML import/export and example monitors (`examples/monitors`); demo monitors with an IoT gateway simulator.
- Monitors UI: list, graph view with root-cause highlighting, editor, heartbeat setup, gateways, status wall.

**Platforms and integrations**

- Platforms for any REST API: OpenAPI import (file, paste, URL), connector types (export/import), encrypted credentials.
  - Retries with backoff that honour `Retry-After`.
  - Per-platform concurrency limit.
  - Credentials only go to the platform's own origins.
- Gatus integration:
  - connector, uptime overview dashboard;
  - pushing results to Gatus external endpoints;
  - outage runbook started by Gatus alerts.
- Sandbox contract checks (`npm run contract`).

**Access, security and audit**

- Local accounts with roles (admin, designer, operator, approver, auditor, viewer), teams, and per-process/per-platform access lists.
- Single sign-on with Microsoft Entra ID or any OpenID Connect provider, with role and team mapping from claims.
- Personal API tokens (read-only or full).
- Tamper-evident audit log: a chain of HMAC-signed hashes, with a verify endpoint.
- Sealed run protocols (HTML/JSON).
- Branded PDF/A-2b reports for runs and periods:
  - reviewer comment and signature fields;
  - SHA-256 recorded in the audit log;
  - verification of archived and signed copies.
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS over TLS, Permissions-Policy), CSRF and DNS-rebinding protection, vault encrypted with AES-256-GCM.
- Retention policy for runs, report files and notifications.

**Observability and operations**

- Dashboards fed by processes: KPI, trend, status and table widgets, freshness indicators.
- Notifications: in-app notification centre, e-mail (SMTP), Microsoft Teams, generic webhooks.
- Structured JSON logs, OpenTelemetry tracing, Prometheus metrics (`/api/metrics`), readiness probe (`/api/ready`).
- Optional error reporting to Sentry, GlitchTip or Bugsink, with scrubbing of secrets and personal data.
- Public read-only REST API (`/api/v1`) with an OpenAPI 3.1 description:
  - API-token authentication, rate limiting, RFC 9457 errors;
  - an optional Swagger UI.

**Running and packaging**

- PostgreSQL as an alternative to the built-in SQLite, with `npm run db:copy` to move data in either direction.
- Desktop executable for Windows, macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) and Linux (x64 and arm64):
  - single file, opens as an app window;
  - per-user data folder, optional autostart at sign-in.
- Installable web app (PWA) with browser notifications.
- Hardened container image (read-only root file system, non-root user) and Compose files for SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- English and German user interface; each person picks a language (stored in the profile), notifications and e-mails use it, and channel posts use the default language from the settings. More languages can be added without code changes ([docs/I18N.md](docs/I18N.md), `npm run i18n:check`).

**Quality and supply chain**

- Test suites:
  - vitest API and integration tests on SQLite and PostgreSQL;
  - Playwright UI tests with accessibility checks (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- CI scans:
  - code and secrets: CodeQL, Semgrep, gitleaks;
  - dependencies: OSV-Scanner, npm audit;
  - configuration and container: Trivy, hadolint;
  - workflows: actionlint, zizmor.
- Container SBOMs (Syft) and image scan (Grype), OpenSSF Scorecard, Dependabot.
- Command-line tools follow clig.dev conventions (`--help`, exit codes, `--json`, `NO_COLOR`).

### Security

- Platform credentials are no longer sent to hosts outside the platform when a step calls an absolute URL.
- The vault rejects shortened AES-GCM authentication tags.
- Every process expression now runs under guard rails by default — a time limit (`SM_EXPR_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 5 s), stack-depth and sequence-size limits (`SM_EXPR_MAX_DEPTH`, `SM_EXPR_MAX_SEQUENCE`), a heap watchdog and regular expressions that cannot backtrack catastrophically — and long evaluations yield to the event loop, so a single expression can no longer freeze the server (DoS).
- Resolved secret values (`$secret()` and platform credentials) may only leave Steward towards the platform's own allowed origins: outbound requests are scanned for any bound platform's secret (also base64/URL-encoded) and the step fails if one would reach another origin. Secrets are masked in their encoded forms in logs too.
- Credentials are re-evaluated on each redirect hop: custom-named API-key headers, default headers and any header carrying a secret are dropped when a redirect leaves the allowed origins, and `https → http` downgrades that would carry credentials are refused (redirects are followed manually, max 5 hops).
- New outbound destination policy (SSRF protection) for process-controlled requests — `http` node, pagination, browser navigation and sub-requests, OpenAPI import by URL — configurable under *Settings → Outbound access* (`platforms` / `allowList` / `open`, `SM_OUTBOUND_POLICY`). Cloud-metadata and link-local addresses and the server's own API port are always blocked, and the resolved IP is pinned for the connection (no DNS rebinding).
- Dashboard datasets are owned by the process that first publishes a key; another process can no longer overwrite it or hijack its dashboard visibility.
- Dry runs can be made read-only for a browser step (`dryRunReadOnly`), and a dry run now warns in the protocol when a browser step performs page interactions that could change data.
